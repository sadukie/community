# Eastern Ohio Tech Community

Over the years, I used to run a website called Cleveland Tech Events where I tracked all the user groups in Northeast Ohio. This list will show all the user groups that I know of that are active and where to find them.

I have expanded to be Eastern Ohio in general because I call Northeast Ohio home and Southeast Ohio my second home. As I learn more about Southeast Ohio, I'll add more here as well.

If you want to find other Ohio tech groups, check out [this Ohio tech list](https://github.com/mjeaton/ohio-tech).
